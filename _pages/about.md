Hey! I'm a fourth-year student studying towards a B.S. in Computer Engineering at Boston University. My current goal is to hone both my software and hardware engineering skills to obtain a wide breadth of knowledge in my field.

Over the summer I interned as a technician at <a href="https://evenkeelpodiatry.com/">Evenkeel Podiatry</a>, where I worked with a small team to optimize CAD/CAM workflow and streamline the manufacturing process for custom orthotics.

My interests lie primarily in XR (particularly VR), where I plan to implement my personal projects.

Contact me via email at <a href= "mailto: adamparzi@gmail.com">adamparzi@gmail.com</a>.
